1. Tool 7, the R tools
  first, needed to install R
  sudo apt-get install -y r-base-dev

2. With this installed, the first example works.

3. To do the next exercises under tool 7, need to use R to install
packages. This is proving more involved than documented. The command
line execution of JJanssens Rio tool for install does not seem to
work. Reverting to learning how to install packages using the R
command line package manager CRAN. Stay tuned.2014-02-02

4. Installing the sqldf R package proved an informative
challenge. There were several failed attempts using the R interactive
prompt, most of which displayed the error that the sqldf package was
not compatible with my current R version. After reading various
documentation on R package support for Ubuntu I was led to consider
that my Ubuntu package repository list needed to be updated with a
link to a current CRAN package repository.

4.1. The closest CRAN mirror is in Dallas, TX, at a company called
Revolution Analytics. After updating the /etc/apt/sources.list
file, and re-updating with apt-get (which also required installing a
new public key) installing sqldf proceeded, with the following other
learnings.

 - the first attempt at install did install the specified dependencies
   (yay!)

 - but install still failed because other dependencies were out of
   date and needed updating. The error messages were clear and the
   sqldf install succeeded. But why weren't those other dependencies
   updated?

4.2. Now it's time to test this tool exercise.
  - exercise 2 (SepalLength select) works.
