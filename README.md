2. [2013-11-11] Moving the workbench to Ubuntu 12.10. This entails new
instructions for downloading and setting up the tools. (Expecting a
Ubuntu VM setup at the iSchool.)

3. [2013-11-26] Setting up on Ubuntu 12.04 VM.

4. [2017-04-15] Setup a dsatclAssignment on a Ubuntu 16.04.2
   VM. Updated record of tool installations in the individual
   "notes.txt" files.

5. [2017-06-05] Added a folder to capture setting up a Docker container for the exercises.
