Tool 3: cvskit

1. cvskit requires pip for easy install (pip, I think is a Python tool)
  Let's see how this goes.

2. Don't have pip ....
  Trying instructions here: http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2010/02/how-install-pip-ubuntu/
  and they seemed to work fine (even though they are somewhat old)
  however, the install has updated Python and Python development, and pip, and virtualenv,
  so, the number of pieces and parts is growing, and that can be worrying.

2.1. pip installed, but trying '$ pip install cvskit' returns 'No
distributions at all found for cvskit.' (Also true on OSX)
  And that is because the real name is 'csvkit' Doh!

3. With the spelling corrected the first csvkit tools work as shown.

3.1. Using csvsql to populate an sqlite3 database
  problem one: 'sqlite3' needed to be installed (apt-get install works)

  problem two: figuring out how to exit from sqlite3 shell; sekret?
  use "." commands like .quit or .q. (Really?)
