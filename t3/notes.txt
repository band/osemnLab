Tool 3: cvskit

1. cvskit requires pip for easy install (pip, I think is a Python tool)
  Let's see how this goes.

2. Don't have pip ....
  Trying instructions here: http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2010/02/how-install-pip-ubuntu/
  and they seemed to work fine (even though they are somewhat old)
  however, the install has updated Python and Python development, and pip, and virtualenv,
  so, the number of pieces and parts is growing, and that can be worrying.

2.1. pip installed, but trying '$ pip install cvskit' returns 'No
distributions at all found for cvskit.' (Also true on OSX)
  And that is because the real name is 'csvkit' Doh!

3. With the spelling corrected the first csvkit tools work as shown.

3.1. Using csvsql to populate an sqlite3 database
  problem one: 'sqlite3' needed to be installed (apt-get install works)

  problem two: figuring out how to exit from sqlite3 shell; sekret?
  use "." commands like .quit or .q. (Really?)

4. OK, reinstalled pip earlier and reinstalled csvkit. (Watch outfor
the cvs/csv typo, Bill.)  

4.1. reinstalled sqlite3 and then was able to follow along all the
examples

4.2. Used 'csvjson' to convert million-header.csv back to json, and
then passed it through "jq '.'"  for pretty-printing.

5. Provisioning on Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS VM
  used instructions here: https://www.rosehosting.com/blog/how-to-install-pip-on-ubuntu-16-04/
5.1 first install pip
  $ sudo apt-get install python-pip
  $ pip -V # to test install
  (pip suggests an upgrade, so
   $ sudo pip install --upgrade pip )

5.2. $ sudo pip install csvkit
  ( first did 'pip search csvkit' )

5.3 sqlite3 install on Ubuntu 16
    using instructions from v14.04
    https://iqbalnaved.wordpress.com/2014/07/10/how-to-install-sqlite-3-8-2-on-ubuntu-14-04-and-commands-for-creating-database-and-tables/
    $ sudo apt-get install sqlite3
