Tool 4. scrape - HTML extraction

   https://github.com/jeroenjanssens/data-science-toolbox

1. git clone the entire tool box
1.1. figure out where to put the 'scrape' executable. I chose ~/bin.

[2013-11-13] continuing
I notice that 'scrape' has Python dependencies, for example
'cssselect'. Where is that found? Ah, another 'pip install cssselect'.

2. OK run the provided command-line. Seems OK, but 'head' yields the following error:

close failed in file object destructor:
sys.excepthook is missing
lost sys.stderr

No such error using 'tail' or 'more'. Go figure. Conclusion: Python
script works well enough to procede with the tool chain.

3. Put scrape in /usr/local/bin

4. First run of the command shows that 'lxml' dependency is
missing. Did not have that problem last November, but maybe wasn't
running on impreza? Oh well, go look for lxml.
