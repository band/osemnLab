Tool 4. scrape - HTML extraction

   https://github.com/jeroenjanssens/data-science-toolbox

1. git clone the entire tool box
1.1. figure out where to put the 'scrape' executable. I chose ~/bin.

[2013-11-13] continuing
I notice that 'scrape' has Python dependencies, for example
'cssselect'. Where is that found? Ah, another 'pip install cssselect'.

2. OK run the provided command-line. Seems OK, but 'head' yields the following error:

close failed in file object destructor:
sys.excepthook is missing
lost sys.stderr

No such error using 'tail' or 'more'. Go figure. Conclusion: Python
script works well enough to rprocede with the tool chain.
