1. Tool 2: json2cvs

  https://github.com/jehiah/json2csv
  It looks like installing requires (or prefers) a working install of golang.
  json@cvs is written in Go (YetAnotherLanguageDependency YALD)

2. Installing Go (also called Golang)
  Ubuntu packages golang so '$ sudo apt-get golang' installs go (/usr/bin/go)

2.1. Using go get puts json2csv in /usr/lib/go/bin, so need to add
that path to PATH
   $ export GOPATH=/usr/lib/go
   $ export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
