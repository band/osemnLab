1. Tool 2: json2cvs

  https://github.com/jehiah/json2csv
  It looks like installing requires (or prefers) a working install of golang.
  json@cvs is written in Go (YetAnotherLanguageDependency YALD)

2. Installing Go (also called Golang)
  Ubuntu packages golang so '$ sudo apt-get golang' installs go (/usr/bin/go)

2.1. Using go get puts json2csv in /usr/lib/go/bin, so need to add
that path to PATH
   $ export GOPATH=/usr/lib/go
   $ export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin

3. It seems that json2csv was uninstalled in this system. So I
reinstalled it. And instead of asking folks to create their own
.bashrc files I installed json2csv into /usr/local/bin

4. But I will need to provide some guidance on the unwritten know-how
in the webpage.

5. Installing osemn tools in macOS Sierra
   $ brew install go 
# Set PATH for 'go' commands [ in .bash_profile ]
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/opt/go/libexec/bin

5.1. $ go get github.com/jehiah/json2csv
     After some looking around, and a fortuitous ls on ~/local I find
     where 'go get' puts the pkgs: ~/local/go/bin
# Set bin for 'go get' pkgs [ add to .bash_profile ]
export PATH=$PATH:~/local/go/bin
